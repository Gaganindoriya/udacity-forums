feel free to make any workable change in this repo 

## Contributions Best Practices
* Write clear meaningful git commit messages
* Make sure your PR contains a small description, also mentioning your Slack ID
* Always sync the fork repository with base before making any pull requests.
* When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.

## Reporting Bugs

* Before creating bug reports, please find out that you don't have created one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible]. Fill out [the required template], the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

## Branch Policy

We have the following branches

* **master**
   This contains the stable code. After significant features/bugfixes are accumulated on development, we move it to master.
* **lucifer0987**
     All development goes on in this branch. If you're making a contribution,
     you are supposed to make a pull request to `development` branch.
